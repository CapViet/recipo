Simply thaw it first and chop it before using it in the recipe. However, keep in mind that frozen lemongrass may have a slightly different flavor and texture than fresh lemongrass.</p><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-green-700"><strong>Q: Can I make this soup in a slow cooker?</strong></h3><p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-4">A: Yes, you can make this soup in a slow cooker!
